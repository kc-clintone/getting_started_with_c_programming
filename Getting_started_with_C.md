## Introduction

C is a powerful and versatile programming language used for a wide range of applications. To begin programming in C, you'll need to set up a development environment that includes a C compiler and a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE).

## Step 1: Install a C Compiler

### Linux
The C compiler is crucial for translating your C code into executable programs. On most Linux distributions, the **GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)** is commonly used and often pre-installed. If not, you can install it using your package manager.

**Ubuntu/Debian**:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gcc
```

**Fedora**:
```bash
sudo dnf install gcc
```

### Windows
For Windows, you can use the **MinGW-W64** distribution, which provides a version of GCC specifically designed for Windows environments.

1. Download the MinGW-W64 installer from [here](https://mingw-w64.org/doku.php/download).
2. Run the installer and follow the installation steps, making sure to select the appropriate options for your system.

## Step 2: Choose a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

### Text Editors
- [**Notepad++**](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (Windows)
  - A lightweight text editor with syntax highlighting.
- [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (cross-platform)
  - A highly customizable code editor with powerful features and extensions.
- [**Sublime Text**](https://www.sublimetext.com/) (cross-platform)
  - A fast and sleek text editor suitable for coding.

### IDEs
- [**Code::Blocks**](http://www.codeblocks.org/) 
  - A free, open-source IDE with a user-friendly interface.
- [**Dev-C++**](https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/)
  - An IDE specifically designed for C and C++ programming.
- [**Eclipse CDT**](https://www.eclipse.org/cdt/)
  - A popular IDE that offers powerful tools for C and C++ development.
- [**CLion**](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/)
  - A professional IDE with advanced features for C and C++ programming.

## Step 3: Write Your First C Program

Open your chosen text editor or IDE and create a new file with a `.c` extension. For example, create a file named `hello.c`.

## Step 4: Compile and Run Your Program

### Linux

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where your `hello.c` file is located using the `cd` command.
3. Compile the program using the following command:
   ```bash
   gcc -o hello hello.c
   ```
4. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./hello
   ```

### Windows

1. Open the Command Prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where your `hello.c` file is located using the `cd` command.
3. Compile the program using the following command:
   ```bash
   gcc -o hello.exe hello.c
   ```
4. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   hello.exe
   ```
